1. int val is passed by value and int* ptr is passed by reference
2. The final value of "alpha" is 20 because "alpha" is defined with a integer variable, not a pointer variable. 
   Since a copy of its value is passed to "processData" function, chaning the value inside the function will not change the original one. 
3. The final value of beta is 30 because "beta" is passed by reference. 
   Since the memory address of "beta" is passed to "processData" function, changing the value inside the function will change the original one directly.
